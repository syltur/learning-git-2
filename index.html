            <h3><i>by Neil Diamond</i></h3>
                <p>Where it began, I can't begin to knowing<br>
                But then I know it's growing strong<br>
                Was in the spring<br>
                And spring became the summer<br>
                Who'd have believed you'd come along</p>
                <p>Hands, touching hands<br>
                Reaching out, touching me, touching you</p>
                <p>Sweet Caroline<br>
                Good times never seemed so good<br>
                I've been inclined<br>
                To believe they never would<br>
                But now I</p>
                <p>Look at the night and it don't seem so lonely<br>
                We filled it up with only two<br>
                And when I hurt<br>
                Hurting runs off my shoulders<br>
                How can I hurt when holding you</p>
                <p>One, touching one<br>
                Reaching out, touching me, touching you</p>
                <p> Sweet Caroline<br>
                Good times never seemed so good<br>
                I've been inclined<br>
                To believe they never would<br>
                Oh no, no</p>
                <p>Sweet Caroline<br>
                Good times never seemed so good<br>
                Sweet Caroline<br>
                I believe they never could<br>
                Sweet Caroline<br>
                Good times never seemed so good</p>
